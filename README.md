# CS 70 Grade Esimator
Please be aware that this is just an estimator and the results are just meant to give you a somewhat decent guess as to what your grade will end up being.

This was specifically made for the Fall 2023 semester, using its final and midterm weightings, as well as the grade data from Spring 2023 and Fall 2023. The weightings and grade data can all be modified in the script.js file.

Data about grade percentiles obtained from the [Cal Viz Grade Database](https://calviz.berkeley.edu/t/OPAP/views/GradesbyCourse/GradesDB?%3Aembed=y&%3AisGuestRedirectFromVizportal=y).

Additionally, the calculations are derived from Reddit user [Reply_OK](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/kbvxd2/calculating_your_grade_in_cs70_and_other_curved/).
